# barbara

Barbara is a native "bar", "dock", "panel", etc. written in [Go][1], using [Qt][2].

Barbara's main goal is to be an easy to use bar, providing a pleasant user experience. Barbara is
modular, and configurable, allowing you to customise and tailor the bar to your needs. One of the 
main aims of Barbara is to be pretty hands-off; some other bar solutions require that you restart 
every so often because part of them breaks or fails to update to reflect changes in your system.

**Barbara is a work in progress**: I'm currently exploring parts of the technologies I'll need to 
make this possible. I want to make sure the bar experience is as seamless as possible. My main 
gripes with other bar solutions revolve around the audio control, the system tray, and the GUI not 
reacting to your system (e.g. DPI scale, or new displays being plugged in, or resolution changes).
